            "source": "Canada is the second largest country on earth with an area of 10 million square kilometers. However, possibly due to its geographical location and cold climate, its population is about a tenth of its neighbor, the USA.  \n\nTo stimulate economic growth and development, the government of Canada over the years rolled-out immigration policies with the intent of attracting the best talents from all over the world. The country has been very successful in its point-based immigration system, so much so, population has been on the steady increase. This is evident in populations growths across several boroughs and cities in Canada.  \n\nIn addition to being popular tourist and vacation destinations, Calgary and Vancouver, the biggest western cities in the provinces of Alberta and British Columbia respectively, are also leading immigration locations. The cities are diverse and multicultural and offer numerous attractions for potential immigrants and tourists.  \n\nUsing available online public data, this project clusters and segments the neighborhoods of Calgary and Vancouver with the objective of drawing insights useful for immigrants and tourists interested in landmarks including restaurants, schools, residential areas, parks, museums, churches, etc.   \n"
